Split Ticket's wins-above-replacement model for 2022

Some notes:
- All calculations use two-way vote share. Independent Cara Mund is considered a de-facto Dem in North Dakota, and Menachem Raitport the Republican in NY-09. All other third party candidates ignored. Montana's 2nd is ignored because there was an independent *and* a Democrat on the same ballot who both got high shares of the vote.
- Spending data from OpenSecrets; the internal estimates were gathered manually while the outside spending can be assembled by the scraper attached (or you can use the spreadsheet itself).
- Data sources: Split Ticket, Max McCall, @cinyc9 of RRH, Daily Kos, and the US Census Bureau
- For single district states, the "shift" used was the standard nationwide shift of 3.85% (average of 2020 pres -> 2022 congressional and 2020 congressional -> 2022 congressional), as there is no real way to calculate the 2020 -> 2022 statewide shift without meaningfully diluting the statewide candidate's strength/weakness. Consider Mary Peltola in Alaska as a good example of this â€” it's not accurate to use a 26% swing left for Alaska as the standard statewide shift, so what we do instead is just assume a generic candidate would have gotten a generic national shift.
- For two-district states, like New Hampshire, a third "dummy" district that swung right by the standard nationwide shift of 3.85% was added in to the statewide "shift" calculation so as to dilute the influence of a single incumbent on the generic ballot's estimate of the states (this is important in states like New Hampshire, Hawaii, and Maine).
- For all other states, the average of 2020 pres -> 2022 congressional and 2020 congressional -> 2022 congressional statewide shifts was used.
